    <h1>Cow disease trading game</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        <p>In the FIELD project we are interested in how farmers make decisions when it comes to preventing
          their cows from getting disease. We have built a game to test this decision making process and we are
          asking you to play it.</p>
        <p>
          We will record your decisions as you play the game and use this in our analysis. We will not collect
          any personal information.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Beef and dairy products go through a complex supply chain before they reach the supermarket shelf.
          To maintain a steady income, farmers are under pressure to get the most out of their land and their
          livestock. This often means buying in new younger cattle from other farms and selling off the older ones for
          the
          right price. The average beef cow in the UK will move location two to three times during its life.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this movement comes a substantial risk of spreading diseases. Many of the diseases affecting
          cattle are endemic. These diseases are not deadly, but they are unpleasant for cows. They cause difficulties
          for farmers as well because affected cows will produce less milk. To combat endemic diseases farmers can
          test, treat, and vaccinate their animals.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <h2>What we want you to do</h2>
    <div>
      We want you to play, and try to win, a game based around the struggles of being a cattle farmer. You
      will try to make money for your farm by selling milk and trading cows with other farmers. Cows are infected with a
      disease, and if it goes untreated it will spread to other cows in your herd and stop them from producing milk.
    </div>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <section>
      <div>
        <img class="game-image" alt="character select" src="{% static 'assets/game/images/game_characterselect.png' %}">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          You will be asked to choose a character. When you enter the game,
          you will see your character standing at your farm. You will also see 5
          other characters standing next to their farms they are your
          opponents.</p>
        <p>
          Each player starts with 20 coins and a pen containing 8 cows. Cows do three things: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make money for the farm by producing milk</li>
          <li>Are bought and sold to other farms</li>
          <li>Can carry an infection which prevents them from producing milk.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The game proceeds over <strong>6</strong> rounds. Each round consists of <strong>two
          decisions</strong>.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div>
        <strong>Decision 1: to treat or not treat your cows for infection</strong>
        <div>
          <img class="game-image" alt="Innoculation phase" src="{% static 'assets/game/images/game_bfree.png' %}">
        </div>
        <p>
          Tap on the hospital in the middle of the screen to choose to 'treat'
          your cows this will cost 5 coins and it will make any infected cows
          healthy cows returning from the hospital are blue to show that they
          have been treated. Tap on your farm to choose to 'not treat' your
          cows this costs nothing, but any infected cows on the farm will
          remain infected.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <strong>Decision 2: who to buy from</strong>
      <div>
        <img class="game-image" alt="Trading phase" src="{% static 'assets/game/images/game_trading.png' %}">
      </div>
      <p>
        Tap on the pen of another farm to bring a cow from that farm onto
        your own farm. 5 of your coins will go to the owner of the farm you
        chose.</p>
      <p>If your cows are treated, you can only choose other farms that have
        treated cows. If your cows are untreated, you can only choose farms
        that have untreated cows.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Top tip:</em> When you buy from another farm there is a risk
        that it might be infected.
        Keep an eye on the infection risk level indicator in the top right of
        the screen and try to choose farms that you think are most likely to
        sell you a healthy cow.</p>
      <p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <strong>End of the round</strong>
      <div>
        <img class="game-image" alt="End of round" src="{% static 'assets/game/images/game_roundend.png' %}">
      </div>
      At the end of the round two things happen:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Infection spreads: the number of infected cows on the farm will double (until there are no more
          cows to become infected).
        </li>

        <li>Cows are milked: each farmer receives <strong>one coin</strong> for every healthy cow on their farm</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>How infection works</h2>
      <div>
        <img class="game-image" alt="Infection bar" src="{% static 'assets/game/images/game_infection.png' %}">
      </div>
      <p>If the farmer does not treat their infected cows, it will spread to
        other cows in the pen.</p>
      <p>
        At the top right of the screen is an infection risk level indicator. This
        indicates how many cows have disease in the game.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Winning the game</h2>
      <div>
        <img class="game-image" alt="End of game" src="{% static 'assets/game/images/game_end.png' %}">
      </div>
      <p>
        The game ends after the 8th round
        <br/>
        The winner of the game is the player who has the most money in the bank.
