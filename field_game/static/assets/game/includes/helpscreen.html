    <p>The game proceeds over <b>6</b> rounds. Each round consists of <b>two</b> decisions:</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline">Decision 1: Treat your cows for infection</p>
    <div style="width: 20%; float: left">
      <img class="game-image" alt="Innoculation phase" src="/static/assets/game/textures/hospital.png">
    </div>

    <p>Tap on the hospital in the middle of the screen to 'treat' your cows, or tap on your farm to skip. This will
      cost <b>5</b> coins and it
      will make any infected cows healthy.
    </p>
    <p><em>Healthy cows produce milk worth Â£1 per turn. Infected cows produce nothing.</em></p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline">Decision 2: who to buy from</p>
    <div style="width: 20%; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
      <img style="max-width: 100%;" class="game-image" alt="Trading phase"

    </div>
    <p>
      Tap on the pen of another farm to bring one of their cows onto your own farm. <b>5</b> of your coins will go to
      the owner of the farm you chose. If your cows are treated you can only buy from other treated farms.
      If your cows are untreated, you can only choose farms that have untreated cows.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Tip: The higher the infection bar, the more likely an untreated cow you buy will be infected.</em></p>

    <p style="text-decoration: underline">End of the round</p>
    <div>
      At the end of the round two things happen:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Infection spreads:</strong> the number of infected cows on a farm will <b>double</b> (until there are no more cows to
          become infected).
        </li>

        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cows are milked:</span> each farmer receives <b>one coin</b> for every healthy cow on their farm.</li>
      </ol>
